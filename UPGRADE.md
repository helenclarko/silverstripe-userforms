## EditableCountryDropdownField

EditableCountryDropdownField is gone since the CountryDropdownField and GeoIP
code has been removed from the SS framework.

## EditableCompositeField

EditableCompositeField has been added to as a Container Field,
This allows users to create side by side fields (left and right aligned fields).
